      <p class="content-title">Staff</p>
      <p class="content-desc">Yacht Crafter is the original creator of the server and serves as the owner. Throughout his Minecraft career, he has become an avid builder and loves to showcase his creations. Many of the towns found on the server were built by or contributed to by him. His favorite type of Pokemon is water. Don’t like that? Spheal with it.</p>
      <p class="content-desc">MKXLIV1 is one of the founders of Andor and helped Yacht Crafter throughout the majority of construction of the server. His obsession with dittos is rather odd, and anything that makes you do a double-take throughout your adventure definitely had something to do with him.</p>
